# New York City AirBNB Python EDA
This file contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on New York City Airbnb dataset.
Some of the analysis I did on this dataset was answering questions like:
  What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
  What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
  Which hosts are the busiest and why?
  Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
